Several month ago, I released [NICSgen](https://github.com/wongzit/NICSgen), [ICSSgen](https://github.com/wongzit/ICSSgen), [ICSScsv](https://github.com/wongzit/ICSScsv), [HOMAcalc](https://github.com/wongzit/HOMAcalc), [ICSSgen3D](https://github.com/wongzit/ICSSgen3D) and [ICSScub3D](https://github.com/wongzit/ICSScub3D), for creating input files and processing output files of aromaticity analyses. Now, I combined these program, and improved the code efficiency, to a new program, the [py.**Aroma**](https://github.com/wongzit/pyAroma).

The usage of py.**Aroma** is similar to those previous program. I provided the source code, executable files for macOS, Linux and Microsoft Windows freely. For more details about how to use, please refer to the user manual. Some useful examples were also uploaded with the main code.
